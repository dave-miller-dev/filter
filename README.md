# filter
Instagram style image filter written in C. Run the application from the command line by running: ./filter -g images/yard.bmp out.bmp for example, to output a greyscale version of the input file commandline argument (image/yard.bmp) which will output a new file (out.bmp) with the filter applied.

Filter type command line argument 1 options are as follows:
-b = blur
-g = greyscale
-r = reflect
-s = sepia

Commandline argument 2 options are the input photo filename.

Commandline argument 3 is the output filename after the chosen filter has been applied.
